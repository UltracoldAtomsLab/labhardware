This is a test setup (very crude) to test our laboratory control.

1) Hardware setup:

[Computer1] <-LAN-> [Computer2] <-- Oscilloscope <-- Function generator
                        |                                  ^
                        |                                  |
                        \-----------------------------------


2) Software setup:

  a) Computer2 monitors the Oscilloscope via USBTMC connection with a
looped script (tekusb2.py).

  b) The measured voltage waveform is saved as an image file
on Computer1.

  c) Computer1 runs a webserver that displays the recorded image
(lab.cgi), and also some control interface, that can adjust the
function generator. If the control interface is updated, the new
settings are saved as a file on Computer1.

  d) On Computer2 another looped script (remote.py) monitors the
settings file for the function generator, and updates its behaviour
(waveform, frequency) accordingly, over USB->RS-232 connection.

3) Current issues:

  a) The USBTMC connections is not very reliable. Lost data are quite
common. Also, the flow-control is not really existent in the current
code because don't know any standard prectice that can be used. Also,
the high resolution data retrieval (the 16bit/width-2 instead of the
standard 8bit-width1) never really finishes, which is a fail.

  b) The Oscilloscope monitoring script eats up memmory quite quickly
(2Gb in about 15-20 minutes or running). Should figure out why and how
to stop that.

  c) Looping is very slow, the web interface needs 20-30s to get the new
data.

  d) The frequency scaling is not reliable on the web interface, the
parameters must be somehow mixed up...


TODO:

  1) Figure out more reliable method of reading oscilloscope.
  1b) If works, make a reusable oscilloscope driver over USBMTC

  2) Find useful prospective real-life setup.

  3) ...

  4) PROFIT!
