wavenet: read WA-1500 wavemeter on LAN

Previously a webcam+computer setup was used to monitor the wavemeter
in our laboratory. It is not too convenient and should be replaced
by a better solution. This project should be just that!

Aim
===

* RS-232 connection to wavemeter
* Minimal software requirements, both for server and clients
* Support for multiple clients
* "dumb" server, should provide merely data, interpretation up to clients
* provide status and diagnostic bits as well
* clients for web/Android/desktop/logging

Operation
=========

* The wavemeter is connected to a computer with RS-232(-to-USB) cable.
* Server program running on that computer at startup:
  * Checks/reads IP address, and advertises it on the network by writing it in a file
  * Connects to COM port
  * Starts listening on a network port
* Client software can read the server's location from the file
* When client connects, can submit certain commands to the server which should reply
  * 'WAVELENGTH' command (without quotes): server queries the wavemeter for current
    wavelength and returns wavelength string to client.

Caveats
=======
* Currently a maximum number of 5 clients can connect to a single server, and only one
  server can run on the network.
* Error codes, other status are not returned, have to check "manually".

Usage
=====
Windows server:
 1) run python script, or
 2) compile into exe by running %python% setup.py py2exe
    run resulting executable from bat
Linux server:
 1) has python anyway, so just run script

Program arguments:
server.exe X A.B.C.D
where X: com port number, eg. if COM3 then 3
and A.B.C.D is the IP address (not needed on XP, needed on Vista)
